                        <li>TuneTalker is an all in one music discussion, cataloging, statistics, and recommendation application for those who love music. TuneTalker will use the Spotify API to take your listening history and will build a profile around you, which will serve as the core for a hub for sharing ratings, comments, and recommendations.
                          You will be prompted to rate and discuss the music you listen to with others. There will be a dynamic feed similar to Twitters home page where users can view the posts and ratings of the people they are following, as well as the pages for what they are currently listening to. The profile built from your listening history will tell you about your listening habits and statistics, which you can share with others. Through our explore feature, users can explore new music tailored to their tastes, as well as find users and posts that may be relevant to them. The explore feature will also have the ability to search and find particular content that the user is searching for.
                          The information for each user will be stored on our own database, and can be accessed by users through a web application. There will be a robust recommendation algorithm that will take users' listening habits and personal ratings for music to provide more accurate music recommendations than other services. By combining music discovery, social interaction, and detailed music cataloging in one place, TuneTalker addresses the problem of music lovers having to juggle multiple platforms. Instead providing one seamless experience for everything music related.</li>
